# microservices-availability-simulator
A software that's using Monte Carlo simulation for showing availability for a combination of microservices.

# Usage
You need the following libraries installed:
- `networkx`
- `mathplotlib`

See [`main.py`](main.py) for an example of how to use the simulator.
Another detailed example can be found in the [examples](examples/README.md) folder.
I also encourage you to read the [article](https://dzone.com/articles/incorporating-fault-tolerance-into-your-microservi)
I wrote about this topic. It explains everything in detail.
